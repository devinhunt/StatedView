/**
 * Stated View
 * The Stated Views allow you to quickly model complex UI behavior 
 * quickly by describing in a simple finite state dictionary. 
 * The states are stored in this.states which is a hash of
 *
 * {
 *   'state1': {
 *     'eventname', 'state2',
 *     'eventname selector', 'state3'
 *   },
 *   'state2': {
 *     'eventname', 'state1',
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Stated view automatically matches this finite state paths and 
 * follow them. When a state is arrived at, it call a function
 * of the same name in the Stated View object.
